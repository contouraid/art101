* [pydicer](https://australiancancerdatanetwork.github.io/pydicer/index.html): a tool to ease the process of converting Radiotherapy DICOM data objects into a format typically used for research purposes. In addition to data conversion, functionality is provided to help analyse the data. This includes computing radiomic features, radiotherapy dose metrics and auto-segmentation metrics. 
* [pyradise](https://pyradise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): is an open-source Python package for building clinically applicable radiotherapy-oriented auto-segmentation solutions. This package addresses two main challenges of auto-segmentation in clinical radiotherapy: data handling and conversion from and to DICOM-RTSS.
* [dicompyler](https://www.dicompyler.com): An extensible open-source radiation therapy research platform that provides tools for working with DICOM-RT data.

### Imaging and Visualization Libraries:

* [ITK-Snap](https://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php): A software tool for segmentation of three-dimensional medical images.
* [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org) with [SlicerRT](https://slicerrt.github.io) extension: A comprehensive platform for medical image informatics, image processing, and three-dimensional visualization with radiation therapy capabilities.
* [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/ij/): A widely used open-source image processing program designed for scientific multidimensional images.

### Treatment planning systems

* [MatRad](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mp.12251): A MATLAB-based, comprehensive toolkit for 3D intensity-modulated radiation therapy with validated clinical accuracy.
* [OpenTPS](https://www.opentps.org): open-source treatment planning system (TPS) for research in radiation therapy and proton therapy. It was developed in Python with a special focus on simplifying contribution to the core functions to let the user develop their own feature 
* [JulianA.jl](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03858): a novel Julia package for radiotherapy, aiming to provide a modular and flexible foundation for the development and efficient implementation of algorithms and workflows for radiotherapy researchers and clinicians.
